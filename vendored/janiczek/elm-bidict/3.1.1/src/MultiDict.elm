{-| A dictionary mapping unique keys to **multiple** values, allowing for
modelling **one-to-many relationships.**

Example usage:

            |> MultiDict.insert "B" 2
            |> MultiDict.insert "C" 3
            |> MultiDict.insert "A" 2

    MultiDict.get "A" oneToMany
    --> Set.fromList [1, 2]
