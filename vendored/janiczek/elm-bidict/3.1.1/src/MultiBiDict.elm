{-| A dictionary mapping unique keys to **multiple** values, which
**maintains a mapping from the values back to keys,** allowing for
modelling **many-to-many relationships.**

Example usage:

    manyToMany : MultiBiDict String Int
    manyToMany =
        MultiBiDict.empty
            |> MultiBiDict.insert "A" 1
            |> MultiBiDict.insert "B" 2
            |> MultiBiDict.insert "C" 3
            |> MultiBiDict.insert "A" 2

    MultiBiDict.get "A" manyToMany
    --> Set.fromList [1, 2]

    MultiBiDict.getReverse 2 manyToMany
    --> Set.fromList ["A", "B"]
